# Discord Football Transfer Bot

## Overview

This is a Discord bot designed to manage football (soccer) transfer negotiations between team presidents and players. The bot facilitates offer submissions, contract negotiations, player releases, and trades through an interactive embed and button-based system.

## System Architecture

The bot is built using Node.js with the Discord.js v14 library and follows a modular command-handler pattern. The architecture consists of several key layers:

- **Bot Core**: Main Discord client handling events and interactions
- **Command System**: Modular command handlers for different transfer operations
- **Handler Layer**: Separate handlers for commands and button interactions
- **Utility Layer**: Helper classes for permissions, embeds, channels, and API integrations
- **Data Layer**: JSON file-based storage for role configurations

## Key Components

### Bot Client (`index.js`)
- Initializes Discord client with necessary intents
- Loads and manages command collection
- Handles message and interaction events
- Sets up event listeners for commands and buttons

### Command Handler (`handlers/commandHandler.js`)
- Processes prefix-based commands
- Routes commands to appropriate handlers
- Provides error handling and help functionality

### Button Handler (`handlers/buttonHandler.js`)
- Manages Discord button interactions
- Handles modals for form submissions
- Routes different button types (offer, contract, trade, release, role)

### Commands Directory
- **offer.js**: Handles transfer offers to free agents
- **contract.js**: Manages contract negotiations between presidents
- **trade.js**: Facilitates player trades between teams
- **release.js**: Handles player releases (mutual or unilateral)
- **rol.js**: Admin role management system
- **transfer-duyuru.js**: Sets up transfer announcement channels
- **serbest-ayarla.js**: Configures free agent announcement channels

### Utility Classes

#### Permission Manager (`utils/permissions.js`)
- Manages role-based permissions
- Handles president, player, and free agent role validation
- Stores role configurations in JSON format

#### Embed Creator (`utils/embeds.js`)
- Creates formatted Discord embeds for various transfer scenarios
- Standardizes visual presentation across all bot interactions

#### Channel Manager (`utils/channels.js`)
- Creates private negotiation channels
- Manages channel permissions for transfer discussions

#### API Manager (`utils/api.js`)
- Handles external API integrations
- Provides player face images and statistics
- Includes validation systems for transfers

## Data Flow

1. **Command Input**: User sends prefix-based command (`.offer @player`)
2. **Permission Check**: System validates user roles and permissions
3. **Modal/Form Display**: Interactive forms collect transfer details
4. **Button Interactions**: Users interact with embed buttons for responses
5. **Channel Creation**: Private negotiation channels created when needed
6. **Data Storage**: Role configurations and transfer data stored in JSON files

## External Dependencies

- **discord.js**: Core Discord API wrapper (v14.20.0)
- **axios**: HTTP client for external API calls (v1.10.0)
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment (v20)

### Third-party Integrations
- **thispersondoesnotexist.com**: Provides random player face images
- **Placeholder image service**: Fallback for image failures

## Deployment Strategy

The bot is configured for Replit deployment with:
- Automated dependency installation
- Environment variable support for Discord token
- Continuous running capability
- Shell execution for bot startup

### Environment Requirements
- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Bot token from Discord Developer Portal
